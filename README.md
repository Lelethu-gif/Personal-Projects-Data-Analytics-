A collection of data analytics projects during my studies in computer science and applied mathetmatics

##Projects
 #1. Student Performance Prediction
-GOAL : Predict student marks using Linear regression & pass or fail outcome using Logistic regression
-DETAILS:
  **Dataset comes from kaggle datasets
   ** Two stage modelling:
      1. Linear regression
      2. Logistic regression
  **Descriptive analysis
  **model evaluation:
     1. R^2 Score ( Linear regression)
     2. Accuracy & confusion matrix
     ** FILE TITLE:
        Linear Regression model
        Logistic regression model
        original dataset : Student Perfomance csv
  **Performance metrics:
     -Accuracy : Approximately 86%
#2. Credit Risk Analysis
-GOAL : To predict loan default using logistic regression with LASSO regularization
-DETAILS:
  **Dataset comes from kaggle datasets
